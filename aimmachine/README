For design notes, see design.txt.

For programming reference, see reference.txt.

This is the aimmachine.  It includes two components:
 1. an OSCAR state machine (oscar2.[ch])
 2. an OFT state machine (actually 2, one for TX, one for RX)

For demos of each:

OSCAR: 
socks4-custom/RemoteSocket.cpp.  To build, run make _twice_.

This is a GPL'd proxy server with the OSCAR bits tacked on.


OFT:
demo/server.c

This is a server that listens on a given port and serves a single file.
